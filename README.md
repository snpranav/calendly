# Better Calendly
Host Calendly on your custom domain.  

### TLDR ðŸ˜Ž
calendly.com/your_username &#8594; book.yourdomain.com  
Works the same

### How it works? ðŸ¤“
Better Calendly works by using the iframe embed that calendly offers but adds some CSS to make it function like the normal calendly app.
